This past week I was so busy I completely forgot to do my blog post. This past week our project was due. There was a lot of complications with this turn in because two of our group mates were out of town. Our group definitely has issues with procrastination and getting together as a whole to work. The most in person collaborative work we have done is meeting for 30 minutes to decide on a data model, and even that needed to be revised afterwards. Other than that we mostly worked through google handout to communicate the hours up until turn in. 

This submission once again was not our proudest moment, but I am sure the next turn in will be more complete and successful. We basically have everything done, functioning, and aesthetically pleasing. The only thing missing for the next phase will be a search funcationaly. I have a feeling this will be slightly heavy for the backend workers. For the front end we have minor things to fix and rearranging of data to work on.

For my tip of the week. READ THE <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">BOOTSTRAP</a> DOCUMENTATION. It makes life so much easier and is very very useful, haha. We spent a little too long on the responsiveness of our website, and it would have simply taken a minute had we read the documentation prior.
