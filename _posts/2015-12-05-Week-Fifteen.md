This is the last week of school. I have been hit with Senioristest to the deadliest level. It is not only that, but I am pretty depressed and stressout about graduating. I feel like there are some things I am just not done with here in austin and as a student in this University. I have had to plan event after event and send of announcements to my 42 relatives. This is definitely a stressful time in my life, but as it is now Sunday and I am done walkng, I feel a bit better. It has not hit me that I am done, but I think I will be emotionally okay. Haha. 

Presentations this week. This week we watched many group present their projects. Overall, I think everyone did a really good job. Looking back I wish I knew more about the backend and contributed more than I did to the front end. I think our website had a lot of potenial, but incoherant teamwork. I really liked the search functionality of some of the groups, even though their design could have used better formatting. 

Another interesting event this week was canvas quizzes. Although these quizzes were extrremly easy the time crunch really messed me up. The pressure was different and it made me nervous for no reason.

JUST MAKE IT TO CLASS ON TIME. If you make it to class on time, you do not need to run. You do not need to be sweaty. You do not need to awkwardly find your seat, and you will not miss attendence and the quiz. Invest in a <a href="https://www.pebble.com/">Pebble</a> watch which can tell you that it is time to leave for class.
