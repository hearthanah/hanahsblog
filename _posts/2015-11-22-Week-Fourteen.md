Next week is presentations. I am pretty excited to see what everyone has come up with. 
This project has been really great. I have had a lot of fun even though we procrastinated on it a little too much.
Working with a group of 5 people was definitely a challenge in itself. I don't think there was one time where we were
all able to meet at once, but with the resources we have these days definitely came in handy. We used Google Hangout often
when there was a lot to discuss, and even remote desktop softwares when everything about our virtual environment or postgres
died. Basic things I had to try was a bower update, or make sure my requirements.txt was loaded. An embarassing thing to admit, but a simple lesson learned. Many times people help me too easily and I don't get to learn things for myself. I'm not sure if any other girls have this issue, but I absolutely think it is a downside to being a girl in Computer Science. (without being sexist)

Last Friday, Professor downing went over some popular Design patterns. That was an interesting class. I enjoyed getting called
on for the first time, haha. He used my name often. Like, "As Hanah and I discussed". Yup. We discuessed that implementation. 
The example we talked about was design patterns dealing with Mazes and Enchanted Mazes.

My tip for this week is to review the code Downing went over and read the chapters out Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. Here is an Amazon link to buy the book: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672?keywords=refactoring&qid=1449458034&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1
