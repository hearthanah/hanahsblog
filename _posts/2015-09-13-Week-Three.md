First project turned in! Collatz. I had started on the project very early on and then left it untouched for about 10 days. I should not have done this. Although I had most of my stuff done and ready to submit, basically, it stressed me out and took me longer than I expected to get the final product ready for submission. This made me realize that getting a large task done, does not compensate for everything else that needs to be done. Small task are very important also and should be considered when estimating the duration of a project. I guess this could be considered a tip of the week, but I thought of a better tip you guys can read about down below. 

So Chris Martin came to our class! My buddy pointed out Chris Martin is the lead singer of Coldplay. Bummer, this Chris Martin was not the same guy, but fortunately he had some pretty useful things to share with us. It was neat Bloomberg makes some many in-house products. I really like that because I feel like it opens up opportunities to make your own customized tools. Another thing Chris talked about was programmers have meetings and lots of them. I have definitely heard this before from other software developers, but it was good to hear it again. The consensus that I have came up with is that the larger the company, the more often you will have meetings. This made me consider practicing presentation skills and listening skills for long durations.

This week I had some strange issues that required backtracking through my github commits. A friend recommended <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">SourceTree</a>. SourceTree is a really handy GUI for Git and Mercurial desktop client. Through out this past week
and the week before I have gotten used to using the command line for my Git needs, but when I wanted to really compare commits and track my actions it was a lot simplier and faster to get done using SourceTree. "SourceTree simplifies how you interact with Git and Hg repositories so you can focus on coding." What I liked most was navigating between commits and seeing my code right in the application. I know that the GitHub website allows for the same things with the differences highlighted for you, but using a GUI was much nicer and consolidated.
