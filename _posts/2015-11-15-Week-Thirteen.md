This past Friday we went over method overriding, in class. I thought I knew Java and I thought I knew method overriding, but I now know this stuff can get pretty rediculous and it can get pretty confusing. Sadly I did not do the best on these quizzes this week. It was greating knowing this though because I have now gone back over these things and it makes more sense to me why we use method overriding. There are so many more applicable uses of method overriding than I learned in the past in CS314 and CS312. 

We also had a talk from Atlassian. Over the summmer I heard this guest speaker and really thought they were interesting. During this semester I did the free trial for Atlassian SourceTree. It was really useful and I thought it was a great visual for Github, but I wish it was free. Another opinion I have about this is that there is more satisfaction in using Github through the terminal. I think it is more useful to know how to use Git through the terminal because then you are not inhibited by gui's.

My tip of the week is to go over Java, not just data structures, but Java specifically. I feel like we always think we know this stuff, and we review enough data structures and such for interviews, but unless you do a lot of Java heavy work, it needs a look at. There are so much more uses to Java than you are exposed to in classes. This is applicable almost all the time, but after these lectures it made me more interested in looking into Java, and i appreciate the language more.
