I found the readings for this past Wednesday's class pretty interesting. The Seven Piece's of Advice for Computer Science students.
<br> &nbsp; 1. Learn how to write before graduating.
<br> &nbsp; 2. Learn C before graduating.
<br> &nbsp; 3. Learn microeconomics before graduating.
<br> &nbsp; 4. Don't blow off non-CS classes just because they're boring.
<br> &nbsp; 5. Take programming-intensive courses.
<br> &nbsp; 6. Stop worrying about all the jobs going to India.
<br> &nbsp; 7. No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.

This is a tip that was not listed in the advice above.
<h2>PREP FOR INTERVIEWS</h2>
I am struggling to prep myself for interviews. Time is running short because the fall semester means recruiting time, and I haven't really begun studying up until now. I found some neat coding sites that are good practice for interviews. 
<br> &nbsp; <a href="http://codingbat.com/">Coding Bat</a> and <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interview Cake</a> have been my go to resouces this past week, aside from the Cracking the Coding Interview book.
