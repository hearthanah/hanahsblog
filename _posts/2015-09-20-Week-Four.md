Every few weeks we are assigned some papers or articles to read, and I really find them an sad  entertaining read. This week we read <a href="http://www.around.com/ariane.html">A Bug and a Crash</a> and <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZBWTovsmUrMJ:nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do%3Fid%3DMARIN1+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">Marnier 1</a>. In both of these situations the outcome of software bugs were large physical explosions. There are many stories out there about bad software and malicious software attacks that result in physical malfunctions, and the moral of them all is that we should always check our code twice and have someone else check it also. This idea ties into the concept of extreme programming and pair programming. Working with others who can give a critical eye on every line you write is very useful.As some of the readings have statiscized, pair programming reduces the chance of bugs, errors, and also increases productivity and speed. Lastly, it is important to take into account how your code could essentially affect/effect consumers or anybody else.

For my tip of the week, check out this summarized article about the <a href="http://computingcases.org/case_materials/therac/case_history/Case%20History.html">Therac 25</a>. I first heard about this case back in CS439 with Professor Allison Norman. It is a definitely a story that has stuck with me through the semesters, and hit me again when my cousin recently passed away from lung cancer. Being a programmer has it's chances at yielding a powerful force in society, and it is inspirational to think what we do can help people but we have to consider it can definitely harm people as well.

This section is definitely for my own personal documention, but here is a tribute to my lovely cousin. Even before cancer she was a big pusher and advocate of doing what we love to the fullest potential. It is heartbreaker she had to leave the world and her young children so soon, but she definitely didn't leave on a bad note. I would say she achieved much more than the average person in her unfortunately short life span.

I love you, Cindy Luong.
